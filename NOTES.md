# Overview

NRE are the main source of data: https://www.nationalrail.co.uk/about-this-site/.  
They are part of, and operated by, the RDG: https://www.raildeliverygroup.com/.  

- TRUST is a low level (not consumer friendly) core system for train positions from NRE: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRUST.  
- Darwin is built ontop of TRUST as a consumer facing system from RDG: https://www.nationalrail.co.uk/developers/darwin-data-feeds/.  

Typically Darwin is the common way to access data: https://wiki.openraildata.com/index.php/TRUST_vs_Darwin.  

RDM is a consumer platform for available data endpoints (Darwin, TRUST, CIF scheduling, and lots more).

# Data Products

## Live Departure Board (LDB)

One of the main data feeds of Darwin from RDG split into a Public Version (PV) and Staff Version (SV).  
Each API is split up into multiple data products on https://raildata.org.uk with seperate API endpoints and keys.  

- https://realtime.nationalrail.co.uk/LDBSVWS/docs/documentation.html
- https://realtime.nationalrail.co.uk/LDBWS/docs/documentation.html

It seems better to blanket  use the staff versions as then have canonical RIDs / UIDs etc and include most of the same information.  

### Reference Data (SV)  

- Station CRS  ->  Name
- Company TOC  ->  Name
