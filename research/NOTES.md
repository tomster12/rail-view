# Information

## Overview

There are lots of available open data from all the train networks:  

- https://wiki.openraildata.com/index.php/Main_Page  
- https://wiki.openraildata.com/index.php/Rail_Data_FAQ  

There are many levels of fidelity you can get data:

- https://wiki.openraildata.com/index.php/TRUST_vs_Darwin.

TRUST is a low level system for train positioning and information from Network Rail feeds:

- https://wiki.openraildata.com/index.php/About_the_Network_Rail_feeds
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRUST  

Darwin is built ontop of lower level services as a consumer facing system from National Rail Enquiries (NRE) and the Rail Delivery Group (RDG):

- https://wiki.openraildata.com/index.php/About_the_National_Rail_Feeds  

## Rail Delivery Group

RDG provide many data feeds and methods of accessing their data.  

- https://wiki.openraildata.com/index.php/About_the_National_Rail_Feeds
- https://www.nationalrail.co.uk/developers/darwin-data-feeds/

the Live Departure Boards Web Service (LDBWS) can be accessed through either:

- SOAP API with XML, registered and accessed through the NRE APIs at https://nationalrail.co.uk
- REST API with JSON, registered and access through Rail Delivery Market (RDM) at https://raildata.org.uk/

This is split into staff and public, where the staff version seems to give more full information.

- https://realtime.nationalrail.co.uk/LDBSVWS/docs/documentation.html
- https://realtime.nationalrail.co.uk/LDBWS/docs/documentation.html

The real time rail information can be accessed through either:

- Push port with ActiveMQ, STOMP, or XML
- Kafka stream with JSON, Avro, XML

The modern method seems to be REST and Kafka streams through RDM.

The KnowledgeBase is a static information source for XML data.
